    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions are raised by the interpreter when an error is encountered, such as when trying to access an undefined variable or when trying to divide by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised, Python will stop executing the current code and look for an exception handler that can handle the raised exception. If no handler is found, the program will terminate and print a traceback message that shows the stack trace of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between syntax errors and exceptions is that syntax errors occur when there is a mistake in the syntax of the program, while exceptions occur when the program is syntactically correct but encounters an error during its execution. Syntax errors prevent the program from being compiled and run, while exceptions occur during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing of the code and will prevent the program from being executed until the error is fixed. Examples of syntax errors include missing or mismatched parentheses, invalid operators, or misspelled keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, exceptions are raised during the execution of the program and can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as trying to divide by zero, accessing an undefined variable, or passing invalid arguments to a function. Exceptions can be handled by the program using try-except blocks, which allow the program to catch the exception and gracefully recover from the error."
